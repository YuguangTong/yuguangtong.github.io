My name is Yuguang Tong. I am a Physics PhD student at UC Berkeley. I work on space plasma physics, in particular studying hot ionized gas coming out of our Sun.

In my leisure time, I enjoy hiking, having fun conversations and play with technologies. I plan to take some serious travelings before I get my degree.

I will add more stuff to this site soon so please check it out later!
